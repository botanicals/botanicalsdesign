        content: Botanicals is family owned and operated. We continue a four-generation
          legacy of horticultural enterprises. We were raised working alongside
          our parents, grandparents, uncles and aunts on their family farm in
          Southern Utah and in the greenhouses and floral shop they operated in
          Northern Utah. There we learned to love the magic of green and growing
          things.

        content: We learned almost from infancy how to nurture them and how to use
          Mother Nature’s templates as a guide for using them as elements of
          design. We love bringing the natural world into the work and living
          spaces of our clients. It is absolutely transformative in a way that
          cannot only be seen, but can be felt. Simply put, plants make us
          happier and healthier.

          We love everything plantscapes. We grew up at Sandia Farms, a greenhouse owned and operated by our family in St George, Utah. There we developed a love for plants and helping other receive the positive effects of having their space plantscaped.


          In the last few years, we have also expanded our business to own two retail locations where we sell ceramic pottery, metal art, yard decor, and more. We have one [location in St George, Utah](/locations/saint-george) and [another further north in Sandy, Utah](/locations/sandy).
