### BOTANICALS FAMILY COVID-19 OPERATIONS UPDATE

![botanicals covid-19 operations update](/posts/2020/operations-update-1.jpg)

We are reaching out to the entire BOTANICALS family to extend our best wishes during the challenging days and weeks ahead. At a time when our regular human contact is modified, we need points of stillness and connection now more than ever. Plants feed us body, mind, and soul. It may be easy to overlook the fact that they are the hardest working element in any space as the leaves and root zones actively scrub and purify the air of bacteria and viruses. They soothe and delight the senses, and nourish and fortify the functions of our bodies. This is why we are committed to all of you to provide access to our symbiotic connection to plants in whatever ways we are able.

#### OUR RETAIL STORES REMAIN OPEN

We can advise you on your DIY home projects and can help you beautify your spaces with plant material and containers.

#### OUR DEDICATED BOTANICALS SERVICE TEAM IS ACTIVE

We are keeping all the plants in our charge in tip-top shape. And are taking the following additional measures:

Service Technicians will be using hand sanitizer between each account, and have nitrile gloves, face masks, and shoe covers at the ready if you prefer, they wear them in your space.

All our employees have undergone additional training to practice reasonable social distancing and have a clear mandate in the event of showing any symptoms to notify us immediately and remain home until they can be tested and cleared.

We continue to monitor ongoing developments and safety information related to the Coronavirus. We are following guidelines from public health authorities, including the Center for Disease Control to ensure business operations continue while working to protect the well-being of our employees and customers.

##### YOU CAN HELP US BY COMMUNICATING IF THERE ARE ANY CHANGES TO THE ACCESS TO YOUR HOME OR PLACE OF BUSINESS DURING THIS TIME.

##### PLEASE CALL OUR SERVICE MANAGER BETH BUCK AT 435-632-8914 TO REPORT ANY CHANGES OR CONCERNS.

### WE WILL BE PUBLISHING UPDATES, TIPS, AND TUTORIALS IN THE COMING DAYS FOR USING PLANTS TO HELP KEEP YOU AND YOUR FAMILY PHYSICALLY AND AND MENTALLY HEALTHY AND ACTIVE.
