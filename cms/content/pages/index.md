          Botanicals is a family-owned business operating out of St George,
          Utah. We offer custom plantscape [designs and
          installations](/services/design/), as well as [plant maintenance
          accounts ](/services/maintenance/)to care for your plants. [Request a
          free consultation today](/request-consultation/) to start designing
          your commercial or residential spaces.


          At this time, our services are in Southern Utah only, but we are also working to the trade only in Northern Utah for design professionals.


          We love everything plantscapes. We grew up at Sandia Farms, a greenhouse owned by our father in St George, Utah. There we developed a love for plants and helping others receive the positive effects of having their space plantscaped.


          In the last few years, we have also expanded our business to own three retail locations where we sell ceramic pottery, metal art, yard decor, and more. We have one location in [St George, Utah](/locations/saint-george/),another further north in [Sandy, Utah](/locations/sandy/), and another even further north in [Kaysville, Utah](/locations/kaysville/).
