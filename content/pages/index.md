          ## Hello Friends,


          **We have a lot of exciting news!** We’re rebuilding our family floral shop and greenhouse in Riverdale, Utah, and while we’re undergoing construction you can find us at our temporary location in  the heart of Roy, Utah. Conveniently located in the same shopping plaza as Harmons. 


          You’re welcome to come and see us at the shop, or call us at the same phone number we’ve always had.


          Our new Gibby Floral location won’t be ready for its debut until 2024, but all good things are worth the wait.


          We look forward to serving you with your floral, plants, and décor needs. **See you soon!**


          Sincerely,


          *The Botanicals Family*
