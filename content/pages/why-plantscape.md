        content: '‘Biophilia’ means a love of life; a desire to be around nature,
          plants, and flowers. There is something special that happens when we
          are around plants: We get happier, we get calmer, we feel at peace.
          This effect plants have on us has been scientifically coined “The
          Biophilia Effect.” At Botanicals, we love to discuss the positive
          effects plantscapes have in our lives, and we love creating
          plantscapes for our clients that maximize that positivity.'

          Botanicals was founded on the promise of making the world a
          more beautiful and healthful place. Human existence is based upon the
          intimate interactions we have with plant life. From the physical
          benefits of the air and food we consume to the psychological and
          physiological effects of enjoyment, reprieve, and peace, plants add
          vitality and balance to our lives."

        ### Indoor


        Indoors we work with a broad palate of tropical plants to bring these powerful oxygenators inside to enhance homes and workspaces. Our plantings bring style and vitality into the rooms they grace. We pair them with exquisite container options and the best planting mediums to bring our clients living art that not only looks fantastic but serves to filter, humidify, and purify the air.

        ### Outdoor


        Outdoors we use container gardening to create focal points to new or existing landscapes and patios. We use combinations of annual and perennial plantings to add punctuation and gorgeous architectural elements that stand the test of time. In addition to our outdoor containers and plantings we offer garden décor item. We have free-standing water fountains and can convert almost any of our high-fired pottery pieces into a water feature. We also offer customized fire features, and décor items that help pull everything together and reveal your own flair.
