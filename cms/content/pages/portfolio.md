        ### Indoor


        Indoors we work with a broad palate of tropical plants to bring these powerful oxygenators inside to enhance homes and workspaces. Our plantings bring style and vitality into the rooms they grace. We pair them with exquisite container options and the best planting mediums to bring our clients living art that not only looks fantastic but serves to filter, humidify, and purify the air.

        ### Outdoor


        Outdoors we use container gardening to create focal points to new or existing landscapes and patios. We use combinations of annual and perennial plantings to add punctuation and gorgeous architectural elements that stand the test of time. In addition to our outdoor containers and plantings we offer garden décor item. We have free-standing water fountains and can convert almost any of our high-fired pottery pieces into a water feature. We also offer customized fire features, and décor items that help pull everything together and reveal your own flair.
