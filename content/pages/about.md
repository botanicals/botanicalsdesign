      ## The Gibby Floral Story


      Great-Grandmother “Hattie”, the original maverick, helped her family survive the Great Depression with a dugout greenhouse selling beautiful fruits, vegetables, and flowers, which she had propagated from starts and clippings taken in Ogden Canyon.


      Her son, Grandpa Grant Gibby and his new bride Blanche, cultivated their love for living growing things by founding a floral shop and greenhouse, in Riverdale Utah, called Gibby Floral.


      The two worked side by side to raise their children and grow their business, treating their customers like family and passing their love and appreciation of the natural world to their children and grandchildren alike. Upon their retirement in the mid 80’s their sons David and Roger continued in the tradition of creating beautiful arrangements and growing exotic tropicals in the family greenhouses


      In 2003, granddaughter, Nicole Hancock founded Botanicals, using what she had learned in design and horticulture and applying it to interior landscape design and maintenance. Joined shortly thereafter by her brothers, Braden and Dustin. As business partners, they have expanded Botanicals to include  design services,  greenhouses, a garden center, two outdoor pottery and fountain locations, and offer educational events about the wonderful world and beauty of all things plants. 


      In 2021, after uncles David and Roger retired, Gibby Floral was brought under the Botanicals Family of Businesses.
