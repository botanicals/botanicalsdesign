      ## Supply and Availability


      Gibby Floral reserves the right to make  adjustments to floral selections and container choices based upon seasonal or supply availability. Your Gibby Floral professional can address any specific requests or concerns you may have.


      ## Memorial/Sympathy Delivery


      If you would like to send an arrangement or planter to a church, funeral home, or event site, please have the correct/complete address, name of the venue, date and time of service ready for your Gibby Floral professional.


      **PLEASE NOTE:** For church delivery, we ask that you provide us the time in which the church will be open and ready to accept deliveries.


      ## Payments


      At Gibby Floral we pride ourselves on having a personal touch. When you place your order online, a Gibby Floral professional will call you personally to confirm the details of your order, and gather your payment information.


      ## Recipient's Phone Number


      To safeguard your gift, we will ask for the recipientâ€™s phone number. This is an extra measure we take to ensure that your gift gets delivered safe and sound and that someone is available to accept it.


      Floral arrangements and planters are very sensitive to extreme temperatures, and sun exposure. If a recipient gives us permission to leave an arrangement on their doorstep, Gibby Floral will not assume liability for theft, or damage.
