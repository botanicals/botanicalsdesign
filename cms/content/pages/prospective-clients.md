          When we make a Botanicals plantscape, we ensure quality and
          timeliness. We understand that a lot goes into building, designing,
          and maintaining commercial spaces.


          This is why we seek to take a burden off your shoulders and help you achieve your goals. After [designing and installing](/services/design) the plantscapes, be sure to sign up for our [maintenance services](/services/maintenance) to keep your plantscapes beautiful.

          ### Architects


          We know that life can get too busy sometimes, and we are here to help. The interior plantscapes are sometimes a detail that cause stress and are a race against a timeline. We want to take that stress from you.


          As you can see in the picture to the right, we design beautiful plantscapes for spaces, and have worked on health clinics, airports, and hospitals, such as Intermountain Health Care locations, and the St George Airport. Please [look through our portfolio](/portfolio) to see our work.


          We will help you get your designs done and beautified with plantscapes, pottery, and custom containers. And remember: we offer top-of-the-line maintenance services, taking all the stress out, and allowing you to enjoy the plantscapes yourself.

          Botanicals loves landscapers! With the addition of [our retail stores](/locations) in [Sandy](/locations/sandy) and [St George](/locations/saint-george), Utah we have been able to better serve landscaping businesses.


          We are currently working to build a Landscapers Program to implement at our stores. Please visit or contact our store closest to you to learn more information, and be sure to check back regularly for updates on the Botanicals Landscaper Program.
