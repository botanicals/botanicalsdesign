    We have a lot of exciting news! We’re moved out of our location in Riverdale
    because we’re in the process of building a NEW GIBBY FLORAL! Our location
    won’t be ready for its debut until 2024, but all good things are worth the
    wait.


    In the meantime, we’ve moved to a wonderful temporary location in the heart of Roy.


    Come and see us at our new location, or call us at the same phone number we’ve always had.


    We’re excited to help you with your special occasions, weddings, memorials, and just something special for the one you love.

    review: I had a very specific and challenging request with short notice and they
      delivered. I wanted large tropical arrangements for my brother’s service.
      Gibby’s had to special order the tropical flowers from multiple suppliers
      that were out of state. The arrangements turned out so absolutely
      beautiful, they pretty much took my breath away.

    review: Excellent locally owned florist and greenhouse! We are new to Ogden and
      discovered Gibby today. They arranged a bouquet for me while I waited and
      we plan to come back in a few months for plants for our yard. They have
      plenty of cactus varieties, succulents, house plants, and floral
      arrangements. Great service and high quality.

    review: Bought my wife some tulips here (my wives favorite) they had a good
      variety and also some very unique red and yellow breed with feathery edges
      that I'd never seen before. She loved them. On sight greenhouse is pretty
      cool. You dont see that all the time.
